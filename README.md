# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app solution

This is a solution to the [Tip calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

It is a tip calculator where users can enter the number of persons included in paying a bill and choose the percentage of the tip. The app will display the tip per person to pay as well as the total amount that each person will pay, making it easy to split the bill and calculate the tip accurately.

## The challenge

## My process

The tip calculator app was built using the following technologies:

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Next.js

## What I learned

During the development of this tip calculator app, I gained valuable insights into various aspects of web development. Some of the key learnings include:

- **Handling User Input**: Implementing the logic to capture user input for the number of persons and tip percentage was a valuable experience. I learned how to retrieve and validate user data efficiently.

- **Dynamic Calculations**: Calculating the tip per person and the total amount for each individual based on the user's input required dynamic updates. I improved my skills in handling calculations and displaying real-time results to users.

- **Responsive Design**: Creating a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes was an essential aspect of the project. I learned how to use Tailwind CSS to create a mobile-first design, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.

- **Next.js and TypeScript Integration**: Integrating TypeScript with Next.js was an enriching experience. It allowed me to catch type-related errors early in the development process, enhancing code robustness.

## Continued development

While completing the tip calculator app, I identified areas that I plan to focus on for continued development:

- **Accessibility**: Enhancing accessibility features in the app is one of my top priorities. I aim to ensure that all users, including those with disabilities, can comfortably use the tip calculator.

- **Localization**: To make the app accessible to users from different regions, I plan to implement localization support. This will involve providing multi-language options for user interfaces and currency formats.

- **Testing**: Expanding test coverage is crucial for maintaining the app's stability and reliability. I want to incorporate comprehensive testing strategies, including unit tests and integration tests.

- **User Feedback**: Collecting user feedback and incorporating suggestions for improving the app's usability will be an ongoing process. I want to create a feedback loop to continuously refine the user experience.

- **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing the app's performance will be an area of focus. I plan to implement techniques such as code splitting and lazy loading to enhance page load times.

By working on these areas, I aim to create a more inclusive, robust, and user-friendly tip calculator app for a broader audience.

Feel free to modify or expand on these points as needed. If you have any other specific topics you'd like to include in these sections, just let me know, and I'll be happy to incorporate them into the README.

## Getting Started With Next.Js README Part
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
